Once you have been at space pirate academy for a while, you get your own
funky visor. It has various modes. My favourite is the one that allows
you to see everything as a large plate of tuna. More important, sections
marked for cat-dets with visors goes beyond the core material but is
still important and should be studied by all cat-dets. However, try not
to be disheartened if you find it difficult. For accessibility, these
sections will also be labelled with <span class="alt">(2)</span>.</li>

Those almost as brilliant as Mae (because no-one is quite as brilliant
as her) get their own space suits so that they can go on space pirate
adventures. They get to shout <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly too.
Actually, everyone here gets to should <em>RRRRRR</em> really loudly.
Try it now. Go on. It feels good. Anyway, this material is the most

<h3>Coding style</h3>
<p>There are (broadly) two styles of coding:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Explicit</strong>: Using this style you declare the
namespace (a.k.a. package name) when using a function:
<code>package::function()</code>. For example, if I want to use the

their namespace. For example, if I want to use the <code>mutate()</code>

to the function as <code>mutate()</code> when I use it.</p></li>

style guide</a> and <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse
style guide</a> recommend an explicit style, and I use it in teaching
materials for two reasons (1) it helps you to remember which functions
come from which packages, and (2) it prevents clashes resulting from
using functions from different packages that have the same name.
However, even with this style it makes sense to load
<code>tidyverse</code> because the <code>dplyr</code> and
<code>ggplot2</code> packages contain functions that are often used
within other functions and in these cases explicit code is difficult to
read. Also, no-one wants to write <code>ggplot2::</code> before every
function from <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
<p>You can use either style in this tutorial because all packages are
pre-loaded. If working outside of the tutorial, load the
<code>tidyverse</code> package (and any others if you’re using a concise
style) at the beginning of your Quarto document:</p>

Overview of the statistical model <span class="alt">(2)</span></h2>
<div id="section-fixed-and-random-effect-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Fixed and random effect models</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking there are two flavours of the meta-analysis model,
both of which are variations on the linear model. The first is the
<strong>fixed-effects model</strong>, in which studies in the
meta-analysis are assumed to be sampled from a population with a fixed
effect size or one that can be predicted from a few predictors. In this
model there is one source of ‘error’, which is sampling variation.
Thinking about this in terms of a linear model we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
d_k &amp;= \delta + \varepsilon_k \\
\varepsilon &amp;\sim N(0, \sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, the effect size (Cohen’s <em>d</em>) in study
<em>k</em> (denoted <span class="math inline">\(d_k\)</span>) is
‘predicted from’ or ‘made up of’, the effect size (size of <em>d</em>)
in the population, which we denote as <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, plus some sampling error, denoted
as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_k\)</span> (the standard
notation for linear models). The usual assumption applies that the model
errors follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 (i.e. on average
the error is zero) and a variance denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. In this model, the effect size
in each study is assumed to have been generated from a single population
with a single effect size and the only reason that effect sizes vary
across studies is because of sampling variance. Spoiler alert, this
conceptualization probably isn’t realistic <span class="citation">(Field
2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The alternative is the <strong>random-effects model</strong>, in
which studies in the meta-analysis are assumed to be sampled from
different populations with effect sizes that themselves vary. In this
model there are two sources of ‘error’: (1) sampling variation (denoted
as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_k\)</span>); (2) variation
between the true (population) effect size from which studies are taken
(denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_k\)</span>). In terms of a
linear model we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
d_k &amp;= \delta_k + \varepsilon_k \\
\delta_k &amp;= \theta + \zeta_k\\
\varepsilon &amp;\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\
\zeta &amp;\sim N(0, \tau^2)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The first line looks the same as the first line of the previous model
except that the population effect size has acquired a subscript of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This difference is important and
reflects the fact that in the random-effects model effect sizes within
studies are not assumed to reflect a single population effect size but
are instead assumed to have come from a population with an effect size
that is different to the populations from which other studies in the
meta-analysis were sampled. So now, the effect size in study <em>k</em>
is made up of the effect size in population <em>k</em> plus some
sampling error. The second line tells us that the population effect size
for study <em>k</em> (<span class="math inline">\(\delta_k\)</span>) is
made up of the true effect size (<span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) and sampling error at the
population level <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_k\)</span>. The
population-level sampling error is assumed to be normally distributed
with a mean of 0 (i.e. on average the error is zero) and a variance
denoted <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>. The random effects
model can, therefore be thought of in terms of effect sizes within
studies being sampled from populations which themselves are sampled from
a ‘superpopulation’ that has a fixed effect size that represents the
‘true’ effect size of interest.</p>
<p>This model can be thought of as a hierarchical model with two levels
of the hierarchy.</p>

<h4>The level 1 (participant level) model</h4>

from the effect size in the corresponding population and some sampling
variation (at the sample level).</p>

<p>The primary role of meta-analysis is, therefore, to use the data from

<div id="section-moderators-of-effect-sizes" class="section level3">
<h3>Moderators of effect sizes</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that the effect size for a study can
be expressed as a linear model. In that model, the effect size is
predicted from the population effect size and some sources of sampling
variation. In effect these models are ‘intercept-only’ models. That is,
the effect size for a study is predicted from only the intercept
(i.e. an estimate of the true effect size). However, familiarity with
linear models tells us that the basic meta-analytic model could be
extended to include any number of predictors. Each predictor would be
added to the model, and would be assigned a parameter that is estimated
form the data. These parameters quantify the size and direction of the
relationship between each predictor and the size of effect. In general,
if we denote predictors with <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
their parameters with <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
(i.e. commonly-used symbols for linear models), we can use the data to
estimate a model that includes predictors:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
d_k &amp;= \theta + \beta_1X_k + \beta_2X_k + \ldots + \beta_nX_k +
\zeta_k + \varepsilon_k \\
\varepsilon &amp;\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\
\zeta &amp;\sim N(0, \tau^2)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Predictors/moderators can be continuous or categorical variables.
When a moderator is made up of several categories then it’s possible to
use any of the standard coding schemes such as dummy coding, contrast
coding and so on. In this tutorial we use an example of dummy
coding.</p>
<div class="infobox">
<p>A secondary role of meta-analysis is to test predictions that the
size of effect will be associated with specific predictors relating to
things like sample and methodological characteristics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-multiple-effect-sizes-within-studies"
class="section level3">
<h3>Multiple effect sizes within studies</h3>
<p>It is the norm rather than the exception that studies contribute more
than one effect size to a meta-analysis. For example, the outcome of
interest might have been measured using different questionnaires
yielding a different effect sizes for each measure. Clinical trials
often use multiple control groups yielding different effect sizes for
the intervention group compared to each of the controls.</p>
<p>We can handle this situation by adding a middle level to our
hierarchy which acknowledges that effect sizes are clustered within
studies.</p>
<div id="section-the-level-1-participant-level-model-1"
class="section level4">
<h4>The level 1 (participant level) model</h4>
<p>At level 1 (the bottom level) we again have the participant level
model in which effect sizes for study <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are predicted from the effect size in
the corresponding population and some sampling variation (at the sample
level). This main difference from the random-effects model is that there
are now two subscripts to acknowledge that each effect size <em>j</em>
is nested within study <em>k</em>. In other words, it acknowledges the
presence of an extra level in the hierarchy.</p>

<div id="section-the-level-2-within-study-level-model"
class="section level4">
<h4>The level 2 (within study level) model</h4>
<p>At level 2 (the middle level) we have the within-study model which
acknowledges that each population effect size associated with effect
size <em>j</em> within study <em>k</em> (<em>{jk}) is itself made up of
the effect size for the associated population, <span
class="math inline">\(\kappa_k\)</span> and some sampling error (denoted

<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_k\)</span> does not have
a <em>j</em> subscript because all of the <em>j</em> effect sizes within
a study have the same population and, therefore, the same population
effect size. However, different studies (and, remember, <em>k</em>
denotes studies) have the same population and, therefore, the same
population effect size so <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span>
varies across studies (<em>k</em>) but not across effect sizes within a
study (<em>i</em>).</p>
<p>The sampling error (denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\zeta_{(2)jk}\)</span>) is assumed to be normally
distributed with a mean of 0 and variance that we will denote as <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_w\)</span> with the <em>w</em> reminding
us that this is <em>within</em>-study sampling error. The sampling error
(<span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{(3)k}\)</span>) reflects sampling
variation across both effect sizes and studies and so has both
<em>j</em> and <em>k</em> as subscripts.</p>

<div id="section-the-level-3-between-study-level-model"

<h4>The level 3 (between-study level) model</h4>
<p>At level 3 (the top level) we have the study-level model in which

the population level).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> has no
subscripts because it is fixed (it is the true effect size and does not
vary by study <em>k</em> or by effect size <em>j</em>). The sampling
error (denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{(3)k}\)</span>) is
assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance that we
will denote as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_b\)</span> with the
<em>b</em> reminding us that this is <em>between</em>-study sampling
error. The sampling error (<span
class="math inline">\(\zeta_{(3)k}\)</span>) reflects sampling variation
across studies and so has a <em>k</em> subscript.</p>

<div id="section-the-composite-model-1" class="section level4">
<h4>The composite model</h4>

made up of the true effect (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>)

<div id="section-moderators" class="section level4">
<h4>Moderators</h4>
<p>Within this extended framework we can add moderators of effect sizes
in the same way as described earlier but the moderators can operate at

only, or they can operate at the effect size level (effect sizes within
a study can have different values of the same moderator in which case
they have a <em>jk</em> subscript.) For example,</p>

The study <span class="alt">(1)</span></h2>
<p><span class="citation">Taylor et al. (2022)</span> reported that in
healthy participants memories of traumatic and comparison films did not
differ in coherence. However, <span class="citation">Brewin and Field
(2024)</span> argued that there is convincing evidence for trauma
memories in PTSD being incoherent or disorganized and conducted a
meta-analysis to estimate the effect size between PTSD status and memory
incoherence/disorganization. Key to the analysis is the fact that there
are two distinct approaches to measuring disorganization/incoherence
with acceptable face validity.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">FOA</span>: This method, based on therapy with
PTSD patients, is to elicit a very detailed trauma narrative that
includes the worst moments and have judges rate individual utterance
units for markers of disorganization such as repetition and
non-consecutive chunks.</li>
<li><span class="alt">Not FOA</span>: This approach is based on judges
or participants rating the entire memory or narrative (rather than
specific details within in). This is the method employed by <span
class="citation">Taylor et al. (2022)</span> among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically effect sizes were generated through one of four memory
coding methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">FOA (Detailed)</span>: uses the FOA methodology
with a detailed coding scheme</li>
<li><span class="alt">FOA (Global)</span>: uses the FOA methodology but
with global ratings coding scheme</li>
<li><span class="alt">Not FOA: (Disorganisation)</span>: does not use
the FOA methodology and uses measures of memory disorganisation</li>
<li><span class="alt">Not FOA (Organisation)</span>: does not use the
FOA methodology and uses measures of memory organisation (the direction
of these effects had to be reversed before the meta-analysis)</li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial works through some parts of the meta-analysis conducted
by <span class="citation">Brewin and Field (2024)</span>. Specifically
we look at conducting meta-analysis using Cohen’s <em>d</em> as the
effect size <span class="citation">(Cohen 1988)</span>.</p>

The raw data <span class="alt">(2)</span></h2>
<p>Usually for a meta-analysis you would input the raw data into a CSV
file. The data for this study are in Table 1. Note the following things
and use the scroll bars to help you see parts of the data</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Each row represents information for an effect size and each
column codes that information</strong>: for example, Berntsen et
al. (2003) in the first row contains information for a single effect
size. The columns tell us things about that effect size such as that
high disorganization is represented by a low score
(<code>high_disorganization_is</code>), a memory questionnaire was used
(<code>method</code>), memories were rated with a method that was not
FOA (<code>foa</code>), the clinical group was PTSD
(<code>clinical_group</code>), and the mean memory rating for the
clinical group was 3.25 (<code>clinical_mean</code>) and 3.25 for
controls (<code>control_mean</code>) and so on.</li>
<li>Studies can contribute multiple effect sizes. For example, Evans et
al (2007) contributes two effect sizes one is based on a global FOA
assessment of memories and the other is based on a detailed FOA measure
(see the columns <code>foa_type</code>, <code>foa</code> and
<code>foa_gp</code>, which combines the two into a single
variable).</li>
<li>Each study has a numeric ID variable (<code>study</code>)</li>
<li>Each effect size (row) has a unique ID (<code>es_id</code>)</li>
<li>For most studies we have the mean, standard deviation and sample
size (<em>n</em>) of the memory rating for the clinical group and
controls (in the variables <code>clinical_mean</code>,
<code>clinical_sd</code>, <code>clinical_n</code>,
<code>control_mean</code>, <code>control_sd</code>, and
<code>control_n</code>). This is the information we need to compute
Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</li>
<li>Sometimes studies don’t include the information we need but report
other information that can lead us to Cohen’s <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For example, the paper might report
Cohen’s <em>d</em> directly, a <em>t</em>-statistic for the comparison
of mean disorganization in clinical and control groups (<code>t</code>
in our data), a <em>p</em>-value, or a correlation coefficient between
PTSD symptoms (or group) and memory disorganization (<code>r</code> in
our data). Note this kind of information for any study that reports
it.</li>

<ul>
<li>The argument <code>measure = "SMD"</code> specifies the effect size
measure to calculate and <span class="alt">“SMD”</span> stands for
standardized mean difference, in other words Cohen’s <em>d</em>. In
fact, Cohen’s <em>d</em> is biased in small samples so the function
automatically applies a correction and technically what we’re working
with is Hedges’ <em>g</em> <span class="citation">(L. Hedges
1981)</span>. See <a href="#section-appendix">the technical
appendix</a>.</li>
<li>The argument <code>vtype = "UB"</code> specifies the type of
sampling variance to calculate. The default is <span
class="alt">“LS”</span> but I suggest changing this to <span
class="alt">“UB”</span>, which gives an unbiased variance estimate <span
class="citation">(L. V. Hedges 1983)</span>. See <a
href="#section-appendix">the technical appendix</a>.</li>
<li>For most studies we will estimate <em>d</em> from the mean, standard
deviation and sample size (<em>n</em>) of the outcome measure for the
group of interest (in this case the clinical group) and the controls. A
series of arguments allow you to specify the variable sin the data that
relate to this information.
<ul>
<li><code>n1i</code> = specify the variable containing the sample size
for the group of interest (in this case <code>clinical_n</code>)</li>
<li><code>n2i</code> = specify the variable containing the sample size
for the control/comparison group (in this case
<code>control_n</code>)</li>
<li><code>m1i</code> = specify the variable containing the mean outcome
for the group of interest (in this case <code>clinical_mean</code>)</li>
<li><code>m2i</code> = specify the variable containing the mean outcome
for the control/comparison group (in this case
<code>control_mean</code>)</li>
<li><code>sd1i</code> = specify the variable containing the standard
deviation of the outcome for the group of interest (in this case
<code>clinical_sd</code>)</li>
<li><code>sd2i</code> = specify the variable containing the standard
deviation of the outcome for the control/comparison group (in this case
<code>control_sd</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As mentioned above, sometimes studies don’t include the information
we need but we can get Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in
a different way. For example, if the paper reports a
<em>t</em>-statistic for the comparison of mean disorganization in
clinical and control groups (in the column <code>t</code>) we can
convert this to <em>d</em>. There are arguments for obtaining <em>d</em>
by other means:
<ul>
<li><code>ti</code> = (if you have one) specify a variable containing
<em>t</em>-statistics that compare your target group to the control on
the outcome of interest (in this case <code>t</code>)</li>
<li><code>pi</code> = (if you have one) specify a variable containing a
<em>p</em>-statistics for a comparison of your target group to the
control on the outcome of interest (we don’t have such a variable in
these data). Be careful with this argument, see <a
href="https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:assembling_data_smd">www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:assembling_data_smd</a></li>
<li><code>di</code> = (if you have one) specify a variable containing
<em>d</em> for a comparison of your target group to the control on the
outcome of interest (we don’t have such a variable in these data)</li>
<li><code>ri</code> = (if you have one) specify a variable containing
<em>r</em> for the association between a measure of your grouping
variable and the outcome (in this case <code>r</code>). I’d recommend <a
href="#section-rd">working with correlation coefficients
manually</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some other useful options
<ul>
<li><code>slab</code> = specify the variable that contains the text
labels for the studies (in this case <code>author</code>)</li>
<li><code>var.names</code> = specify names for the variables that
<code>escalc</code> creates. I’d suggest <code>g</code>,
<code>v_g</code> for the effect size and its variance respectively.</li>
<li><code>data</code> = specify the name of the tibble you want to use
(in this case <code>brewin_2024</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For these data the final code will look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brewin_2024g &lt;- metafor::escalc(measure = &quot;SMD&quot;,
                vtype = &quot;UB&quot;,

                n2i = control_n,
                m1i = clinical_mean,
                m2i = control_mean,
                sd1i = clinical_sd,
                sd2i = control_sd,
                ti = t,

                data = brewin_2024) |&gt; 
  as_tibble()</code></pre>
<p>Notice at the end I have piped the output into
<code>as_tibble()</code> which converts the data to a tibble. I have
stored this <code>tibbble</code> as <code>brewin_2024g</code> (outside
of this tutorial you could instead replace the original tibble by

<strong>Information</strong></p>
<p>Some studies that we wanted to use did not report means and standard
deviations for the relevant groups and/or measures, but instead provided
a correlation coefficient between PTSD symptoms and memory
disorganization. This section describes how to handle converting between
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span>, but is quite technical. For
those who want to ignore it, <code>brewin_es</code> contains the data
with all of the effect sizes included so you can move straight onto the
next section.</p>
</div>
<p>There are two main types of Pearson correlation coefficient that you
might want to convert to <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard <em>r</em>: The standard Pearson correlation measures the
association between two continuous variables. In this example, if a
study reported the correlation between PTSD symptoms and memory
disorganization then this is a standard correlation.</li>
<li>Biserial <em>r</em>: The biserial correlation is the Pearson
correlation between one continuous variable and one dichotomous variable
(i.e. categorical variable made up of two categories). The dichotomous
variable is assumed to have an underlying continuum. In this example, if
a study reported the correlation between group membership (clinical or
control) and memory disorganization then this is a biserial
correlation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the relevant descriptive information is available the formulae
in <span class="citation">Mathur and VanderWeele (2020)</span> can be
used to convert a standard Pearson correlation coefficient into <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{d} &amp;= \frac{r\Delta}{s_x\sqrt{1-r^2}} \\
\widehat{SE}_\hat{d}
&amp;=  \left|\hat{d}\right|\sqrt{\frac{1}{r^2(N-3)} + \frac{1}{2(N-1)}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In which <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the correlation
coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(s_x\)</span> is the standard
deviation of the predictor variable (in this case PTSD symptoms), <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the total sample size on which <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is based and <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> specifies a change in the
predictor that is of interest to the researcher. The standard error of
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> uses the absolute value of the
estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\left|\hat{d}\right|\)</span>
the variance is the standard error.</p>
<p>This equation expresses the effect in terms of the change in the
outcome variable resulting from an increase of <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> units in the continuous predictor
measure. So, for these data if we set <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
= 10\)</span>, then the resulting <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> expresses the change in memory
disorganization associated with a 10-unit increase in PTSD symptoms.</p>
<p>To make the resulting <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span>
comparable to studies for which <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
represented mean differences in disorganization between PTSD and control
groups, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> for a given study
was set to be the difference between the mean PTSD scores in PTSD and
control groups.</p>
<p>To apply this formula, the standard deviation of the PTSD measure
(<span class="math inline">\(s_x\)</span>) for the entire sample is
required. Articles that did not report descriptive information for the
PTSD measure for the entire sample did report it for PTSD and control
subgroups allowing the whole sample variance (<span
class="math inline">\(s^2_\text{combined}\)</span>) to be estimated
using <a href="#section-appendix">a standard formula</a>. Where this
information was not available the formulae to convert a point biserial
correlation can be used</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{d} &amp;= \frac{2r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}} \\
\widehat{SE}_\hat{d} &amp;=  \frac{2}{\sqrt{(N-1)(1-r^2)}}.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In effect, this is the same as applying the equation in <span
class="citation">Mathur and VanderWeele (2020)</span> but with <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta = 2s_x\)</span>. In other words, it will
yield the same value as the equation used for a continuous measure if
PTSD and control groups had a mean difference on a continuous PTSD
measure of about 2 standard deviations.</p>
<p>In both cases the variance of <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> is the <span
id="section-appendix">standard error squared</span>.</p>
<p>OK, so how do we implement this in

This package has a couple of helper functions that you can use along
with standard tidyverse functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pooled_var(nx, ny, sdx, sdy, ux, uy, sd = F)</code> calculates
the pooled standard deviation of two groups based on specifying the
variables that relate to the group sample sizes (<code>nx</code> and
<code>ny</code>), standard deviations (<code>sx</code> and
<code>sy</code>), and their means (<code>ux</code> and
<code>uy</code>).</li>
<li><code>d_from_r(delta, sx, r)</code> converts a standard or biserial
Pearson correlation to <em>d</em>. You need to specify the following
arguments
<ul>
<li><code>sx</code>: this needs to be set to the name of the variable
containing the whole sample standard deviation of the predictor (in our
data this variable is called <code>ptsd_sd_all</code>)</li>
<li><code>r</code>: this needs to be set to the name of the variable
containing the correlation coefficient</li>
<li><code>delta</code>: set this to the value of delta that you want. In
out case, we set this to be the difference in mean PTSD in the two
groups. If this argument is not set the equation to convert a biserial
<em>r</em> is used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>d_to_g</code> applies Hedge’s correction to <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span></li>
<li><code>var_d_from_r</code> calculates the variance for Hedges’
<em>g</em> based on a correlation coefficient.</li>

to coding hell:</p>

<p>Let’s translate this code in steps:</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-general-idea" class="section level4">
<h4>The general idea</h4>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to add variables to
<code>brewin_2024g</code> using <code>dplyr::mutate()</code> and then
store this new version of the data as a new tibble called
<code>brewin_es</code>. (If you prefer you can save it over the original
tibble.) This is achieved using
<code>brewin_es &lt;- brewin_2024g |&gt;  dplyr::mutate(...)</code>. The
code <em>within</em> mutate controls what variables are created and
added to the tibble.</p>

<strong>Tip</strong></p>
<p>Multiple times we use standard functions and operators that you might
have met before.</p>
<p>The <code>ifelse()</code> which takes the following format</p>
<pre class="r panel_alt"><code>ifelse(condition_to_be_met,
       do_this_if_condition_is_met,
       do_this_if_condition_is_NOT_met)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, within the function you set a condition, then you say what
you’d like to happen if the condition is met, and then what you’d like
to happen if it is not met.</p>
<p>The <code>is.na()</code> function tells us whether a given case of a
variable is an <code>NA</code>.</p>
<p>The operator <code>!</code> negates something. For example,
<code>!is.na()</code> tells us whether a given case of a variable is
<span class="alt">not</span> an <code>NA</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>|</code> operator means ‘or’.</p>

<code>g</code> to be the existing value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: the first lines changes the existing variable
<code>g</code>to insert the values of <em>d</em> we have calculated but
converted to Hedges’ <em>g</em>. The second line reverses the direction
of the effect <em>if</em> the variable
<code>high_disorganization_is</code> tells us that this effect size is
from a measure of organisation (rather than disorganization).</p>

<p>This line changes the existing variable <code>v_g</code> to insert
the variance values for the <em>g</em>s we have calculated. This uses
two nested <code>ifelse()</code> statements. The first
<code>ifelse()</code> sets different rules depending on whether values
for the variable <code>v_g</code> are missing. When they are missing, we
move into the second <code>ifelse()</code> statement, but if they are
not then we use the existing values. The second <code>ifelse()</code>
statement sets different rules depending on whether
<code>ptsd_diff</code> has a value When it was the variance is
calculated assuming <em>r</em> was a standard Pearson correlation, and
when not it is calculated assuming <em>r</em> was a biserial
correlation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: this code changes the existing variable <code>v_g</code>. If
a value exists for <code>v_g</code> it is retained, but if it is missing
it is computed in one of two ways. If a value of <code>ptsd_diff</code>
exists then the variance is calculated assuming <em>r</em> was a
standard Pearson correlation, and when not it is calculated assuming
<em>r</em> was a biserial correlation.</p>

Aggregating the data <span class="alt">(2)</span></h3>
<p>You might have data where every study contributes only a single
effect size. In which case skip this section. However, that’s not the
case for the data in this example. We can fit a model to the data as is,
but if we want to create forest plots (more on them shortly) we will
need a version of the data where we have aggregated within studies (or
some other variable of interest).</p>

Code example</h4>
<p>To aggregate effect sizes within a variable we can use the
<code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code> functions from
<code>dplyr</code>. For example, this code</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brewin_agg &lt;- brewin_es |&gt; 
  dplyr::group_by(author) |&gt; 
  dplyr::summarize(
    g = mean(g, na.rm = T),
    v_g = mean(v_g, na.rm = T),
    n = mean(n_total, na.rm = T)
  )</code></pre>
<p>takes the data in <code>brewin_es</code> and then groups it by the
variable <code>author</code> (which identifies the study) and creates
the variables <code>g</code>, <code>v_g</code> and <code>n</code> which
are the average of the original variables of the same name. In other
words, if a study has three values of <code>g</code> it will occupy
three rows in the original tibble, but in this new tibble it will occupy

<p>The current data are a bit more complicated than this because
different measures of memory disorganization were used within some
studies. The key hypothesis in this study is around how trauma memories
were coded. This information is stored in the variable
<code>foa_gp</code>. The aggregation we have just done loses all of the
information about the type of memory coding used for a given effect
size.</p>

Code example</h4>
<p>If we want to aggregate taking the information in <code>foa_gp</code>
into account we can add this variable to the <code>group_by()</code>
function. The following code will aggregate effect sizes within each
study, separately if they have different values of <code>foa_gp</code>.
Note the only difference in this code is that we have added
<code>foa_gp</code> into <code>group_by()</code> before
<code>author</code>.</p>

One effect size per study <span class="alt">(2)</span></h3>
<p>When we have a single effect size per study (as we do in <span
class="alt">brewin_agg</span>), we can use the <code>rma()</code>
function from <code>metafor</code> to fit a random effects model. The
function has the following form</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_model &lt;- rma(yi = variable_containing_effect_sizes,
                vi = variable_containing_effect_size_variances,

                subset = specify_a_subset_of_the_tibble)</code></pre>
<p>There are actually many more arguments, but the ones above are the
only ones we need. We will look at <a
href="#section-mods">moderators</a> later, where we’ll cover the <span
class="alt">mods</span> and <span class="alt">subset</span> arguments.
For now we will fit a no frills model.</p>

<p>The output contains several statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>An estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>: this
tells us the estimate of the variability in population effect sizes (see
the theory section). In this case <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}^2\)</span> = 0.02.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> statistic is the
percentage of the variability in effect sizes attributable to
heterogeneity and not sampling error. Broad cut-offs of 25%, 50%, and
75% have been tentatively proposed for low, moderate, and high levels of
heterogeneity <span class="citation">(Higgins 2003)</span>, but these
should not be applied thoughtlessly and context matters. In this case
<span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> = 25.76%.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(H^2\)</span> statistic is,
essentially, a transformed and less intuitive version of <span
class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span>. It varies from 1 (homogeneity) to
infinity (extreme heteroscedasticity). Probably just interpret <span
class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> and forget about <span
class="math inline">\(H^2\)</span></li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> statistic tests the null
hypothesis that effect sizes across studies are equal. A significant
test can, therefore, be used to reject this null in favour of believing
that heterogeneity exists. A non-significant test implies that
heterogeneity wasn’t sufficient;y large to be detected in the current
sample. This test has notoriously low power, so non-significant results
especially should be treated tentatively. In the current sample <span
class="math inline">\(Q_E\)</span>(17) = 22.64, <em>p</em> = 0.161</li>
<li>The main part of the output is the estimate of <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (using our earlier general
notation), which in this case is our estimate of the population effect
size <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} = \hat{g}\)</span>
(remembering that we converted our <em>d</em>s to <em>g</em>s before
fitting the model). We are told the estimate itself, it’s confidence
interval and a significance test of the null that the effect size is
zero. For these data, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta}\)</span>
= 0.31 [0.18, 0.45], <em>z</em> = 4.70, <em>p</em> &lt; .001.</li>

<p>About <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> = 25.76% of
variability in effect sizes was attributable to heterogeneity. With the
caveats that this test is underpowered, the observed heterogeneity was
not significantly different than zero, <span
class="math inline">\(Q_E\)</span>(17) = 22.64, <em>p</em> = 0.161.
Overall there was about a third of a standard deviation difference in

<em>z</em> = 4.70, <em>p</em> &lt; .001. If we assume that this sample
is one of the 95% that generates a confidence interval that captures the
population value then this differences could be as small as 0.18
standard deviations and as large as 0.45 standard deviations.</p>

Multiple effect sizes per study <span class="alt">(2)</span></h3>
<p>When we have multiple effect size per study (as we do in <span
class="alt">brewin_es</span>), we use the <code>rma.mv()</code> function
from <code>metafor</code> to fit a random effects model. The function
has the following form</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_model &lt;- rma.mv(yi = variable_containing_effect_sizes,
                   V = variable_containing_effect_size_variances,
                   random = ~1|variable_identifying_study/variable_identifying_effect_size
                   mods = specify_moderator_variables,
                   data = a_tibble,
                   subset = specify_a_subset_of_the_tibble,
                   method = &quot;REML&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The function is similar to <code>rma()</code> except that the effect
size variance argument is named <code>V</code> rather than
<code>vi</code>. One important difference is that we have to specify the
nesting of the effect sizes within studies using the <code>random</code>
argument. Essentially you need a numeric variable in the data that
identifies each ‘cluster’ within which effect sizes are nested. Usually
the ‘cluster’ is the study or article, but it could be something else.
You also need a variable that uniquely identifies each effect size. In
the current data <code>author</code> identifies each study and
<code>es_id</code> identifies each effect size.</p>

<p>Execute the following code, which selects the variables in the data
that identify the studies, the effect size id, and the effect size
itself. We view just the first 20 rows of the data.</p>

<p>You can see that, for example, the study by Halligan et al. (2003)
contributed 9 effect sizes to the data. These are identified both by the
variable <code>author</code> (which tells us that these 9 effect sizes
are clustered within the same study), and the variable
<code>es_id</code> (which uniquely identifies the particular effect
size).</p>
<p>To specify this nested structure we would, therefore, use</p>
<pre class="r"><code>random = ~1|author/es_id</code></pre>
<p>Within <code>rma.mv()</code> we can specify whether to estimate the
model parameters using the default of restricted maximum likelihood
estimation (<span class="alt">method = “ML”</span>) or full maximum
likelihood, which is necessary if you want to compare nested models
<span class="alt">method = “ML”</span>. As with <code>rma()</code> there
are many more arguments that we won’t cover in this tutorial.</p>

between 0.18 and 0.45 standard deviations higher than in control
groups.</p>

<p>It also possible to fir the model using robust estimates of the
variances and covariances by placing the model into
<code>metafor::robust()</code>. This function takes the form</p>
<pre class="r"><code>metafor::robust(my_model, cluster = variable_identifying_study)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, you place your model into the function and specify the
variable that identifies the ‘clusters’ in the data (in the current
context our clusters are the different studies included in the
meta-analysis, which are identified by the variable
<code>author</code>).</p>

Forest plots <span class="alt">(2)</span></h2>
<p>A forest plot is a plot of each effect size and its confidence
interval (usually) stacked vertically. The box displaying the effect
size is scaled to reflect the precision of the effect size. Larger boxes
indicate studies with greater sample sizes (and hence greater
precision). In a meta-analysis studies based on larger samples
(i.e. those with the least sampling error) are given more weight than
smaller (less precise) studies. Therefore, the size of the box tells you
something about the weight of effect size within the meta-analysis.</p>
<p>The <code>metafor</code> package contains a very flexible system for
creating forest plots (and other plots). At the core of this system is
the <code>forest()</code> function. With flexibility comes a world of
pain for trying to explain it all. So, to avoid that pain we’ll look
only at some of the key features of the <code>forest()</code> function.
If you want to do anything more complicated then see some of the
excellent examples at <a
href="https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/plots">https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/plots</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>forest()</code> function takes the following form (with
only a fraction of the numerous arguments listed).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>forest(my_model,
       slab = variable_identifying_unique studies,
       header = &quot;Name for the list of studies&quot;,
       cex = numeric_value,
       cex.lab = numeric_value,
       xlab = &quot;label for x-axis&quot;,
       xlim = c(lower_limit, upper_limit),
       at = seq(start, stop, step),
       shade = TRUE,
       mlab = metahelpr::forest_add_het(model = my_model))</code></pre>
<p>Essentially you put your model created with <code>rma()</code> into
<code>forest</code> and that’s it unless you want to specify some
options. So a basic forest plot for <code>brewin_ma</code> is created
with <code>forest(brewin_ma)</code>. It’s as simple as that. However,
you will probably want to change some things. The best way to see what
the options do is to change them and look at the effect.</p>

<p>To see what the different arguments do, use the code box to work
through the following steps to build up the code like above. At each
step add the suggested argument in a new line (remember to put a comma
between the arguments), <span class="alt">execute the code</span> and
see what effect it has on the plot. If you get stuck, the hints show the
correct code for each step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plot a default plot with <code>forest(brewin_ma)</code></li>
<li>By default the studies are listed as “Study 1”, “Study 2” etc. Let’s
label them using the <code>author</code> variable from the data by
adding the argument <code>slab = author</code>. The left hand column
should now show the study names.</li>
<li>We can add a heading to the column with the study names by adding
<code>header = "Study name"</code> (you can change the text in quotes to
whatever you want your heading to be).</li>
<li>Everything looks a bit small. We can change this by scaling
everything using <code>cex</code>. This is definitely an argument to
play around with until everything looks how you want it. Try adding
<code>cex = 0.6</code> but try other values to get a feel for what
changing the value does.</li>
<li>The text below the <em>x</em>-axis (which says ‘observed outcome’)
looks big. We can scale this separately using <code>cex.lab</code>. Try
setting this to <code>cex.lab = 1</code>, but again try different values
and note the effect.</li>
<li>The <em>x</em>-label of ‘observed outcome’ isn’t informative, so we
can set this using <code>xlab = "Memory disorganization"</code> (again
change the text in quotes to what you want it to be).</li>
<li>The gap between the left and right columns and the plot in the
middle can be reduced or expanded by setting the limits of the
<em>x</em>-axis. The effect size data range from -1 to 2, so we could
set limits of say -2.5 and 2.5 to see if this reduces the white space.
Add the argument <code>xlim = c(-2.5, 2.5)</code> to do this (and again
try different values and observe the effect when you execute the
code).</li>
<li>We can set the intervals on the <em>x</em>-axis using
<code>at</code>. The effect size data range from -1 to 2, so an interval
of 0.5 might be good. If we include <code>at = seq(-1, 2, 0.5)</code>
this will create ticke between -1 and 2 at intervals of 0.5 (that is,
-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2).</li>
<li>If we include <code>shade = TRUE</code> alternate lines of the plot
will be shaded which can make it easier to see which data relates to
which study.</li>
<li>Finally, we can add a label at the bottom of the plot with
<code>mlab</code>. This tutorial comes with a helper function
(<code>forest_add_het()</code>) that adds heterogeneity statistics from
a model to a forest plot. To add the heterogeneity statistics for our
model (<span class="alt">brewin_ma</span>) we need to include
<code>mlab = metahelpr::forest_add_het(model = brewin_ma)</code>.</li>

The moderation model <span class="alt">(2)</span></h3>
<p>We saw in the <a href="#section-theory">theory section</a> that you
can add predictors to the model to see the extent to which effect sizes
are predicted by characteristics associated with them. This is sometimes
referred to as <span class="alt">meta-regression</span> but I don’t like
this term because, although I can see why its used, it implies that a
different model is being fitted when moderators are included to the
model that estimates only the overall effect size (i.e. the intercept).
In fact, the underlying model is the same all that changes is whether
you include only the intercept (standard meta-analysis) or include
predictors (moderator analysis/meta-regression). So, make me happy and
don’t refer to this as meta-regression.</p>
<p>In the current example there was a specific prediction that the way
in which trauma memories were coded would predict the size of the effect
observed. The variable <code>foa_gp</code> represents the way in which
memories were coded for disorganization see the <a
href="#section-study">study description</a>. As a brief reminder there
were four ways in which memories were coded:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="alt">FOA (Detailed)</span>: uses the FOA methodology
with a detailed coding scheme</li>
<li><span class="alt">FOA (Global)</span>: uses the FOA methodology but
with global ratings coding scheme</li>
<li><span class="alt">Not FOA: (Disorganisation)</span>: does not use
the FOA methodology and uses measures of memory disorganisation</li>
<li><span class="alt">Not FOA (Organisation)</span>: does not use the
FOA methodology and uses measures of memory organisation (the direction
of these effects had to be reversed before the meta-analysis)</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific hypothesis was that the <strong>FOA (Detailed)</strong>
method would generate larger effects than all other methods. Given we
want to use a single category as a reference we can use standard dummy
coding to fit the following model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
d_{jk} &amp;= \theta + \beta_1(\text{FOA}_\text{Detailed} \text{ vs.
FOA}_\text{Global})_k  + \beta_2(\text{FOA}_\text{Detailed} \text{ vs.
Not FOA}_\text{Disorganisation})_k + \\
&amp;\quad \beta_3(\text{FOA}_\text{Detailed} \text{ vs. Not
FOA}_\text{Organisation})_k + \zeta_{(2)jk} + \zeta_{(3)k} +
\varepsilon_{jk} \\
\varepsilon &amp;\sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\
\zeta_{(2)} &amp;\sim N(0, \sigma_w^2) \\
\zeta_{(3)} &amp;\sim N(0, \sigma_b^2) \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the data there are three variables representing these dummy
variables</p>
<ul>
<li><code>global_vs_detail</code>: is coded 0 for effect sizes relating
to the FOA (detailed) method and 1 for effect sizes relating to the FOA
(global) method.</li>
<li><code>dis_vs_detail</code>: is coded 0 for effect sizes relating to
the FOA (detailed) method and 1 for effect sizes relating to the not FOA
(disorganisation) method.</li>
<li><code>org_vs_detail</code>: is coded 0 for effect sizes relating to
the FOA (detailed) method and 1 for effect sizes relating to the not FOA
(organisation) method.</li>
</ul>
<p>To include these predictors we assign them to the model as a formula
using the <code>mods</code> argument of the <code>rma()</code> and
<code>rma.mv()</code> functions. If you are familiar with the
<code>lm()</code> function, then it’s your lucky day because we use the
same syntax. That is, if you want to add a single moderator the general
syntax is (replacing <code>moderator_1</code> and
<code>moderator_2</code> with the names of your variables):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mods = ~moderator_1</code></pre>
<p>For two moderators with no interaction:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mods = ~moderator_1 + moderator_2</code></pre>
<p>For two moderators with the interaction between them</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mods = ~moderator_1*moderator_2</code></pre>
<p>or equivalently</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mods = ~moderator_1 + moderator_2 + moderator_1:moderator_2</code></pre>
<p>and so on. We want to add in the variables
<code>global_vs_detail</code>, <code>dis_vs_detail</code> and
<code>org_vs_detail</code> so the <code>mods</code> argument will be</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mods = ~global_vs_detail + dis_vs_detail + org_vs_detail</code></pre>

Code example</h4>
<p>To add these three moderators to our model we would take the code we
used to fit the model without the moderators:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brewin_mod &lt;- rma.mv(yi = g,
                     V = v_g,
                     random = ~1|author/es_id, data = brewin_es)</code></pre>
<p>and assign a formula indicating how the moderators should be included
to the <code>mods</code> argument:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brewin_mod &lt;- rma.mv(yi = g,
                     V = v_g,
                     mods = ~global_vs_detail + dis_vs_detail + org_vs_detail,
                     random = ~1|author/es_id, data = brewin_es)</code></pre>
<p>As before, we get a robust version of this model by passing it into
<code>robust</code> and specifying the variable representing the
clusters (in this case studies):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brewin_rob &lt;- robust(brewin_mod, cluster = author)</code></pre>

It is common when this is true for a categorical moderator to run
individual meta-analysis within each category of the moderator. In this
case this would mean running four meta-analyses, one for each category
of memory coding. We can do this using the <code>subgroup</code>
argument of the <code>rma()</code> and <code>rma.mv()</code> functions.
We use this argument by assigning a logical argument to it. For example,
to fit a meta-analysis only using the effect sizes that used detailed
FOA methodology, we would include:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>subset = (foa_grp == &quot;FOA (Detailed)&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The stuff in parenthesis is a logical argument that says ’include the
effect size of the value of the variable <code>foa_gp</code> exactly
matches the text string <span class="alt">“FOA (Detailed)”</span>. You
have to make sure that your text string <em>exactly</em> matches the
label of the group.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s fairly tedious fitting separate models, which is why I
have written a helper function (<code>metahelpr::get_mas()</code>) that
fits models to individual categories and tabulates the results. It may
or may not work because I’m not that good at writing functions. You’re
welcome. This function takes the general form</p>
<pre class="r"><code>metahelpr::get_mas(tibble = name_of_your_tibble,
                   predictor = name_of_the_categorical_variable,
                   es = name_of_the_variable_containing_effect_sizes,
                   var_es = name_of_the_variable_containing_effect_size_variances,
                   es_id = name_of_the_variable_containing_effect_size_identifier, # optional
                   study_id = name_of_the_variable_containing_cluster_identifier, # optional
                   digits = number_of_decimal_places_to_use_in_table (default is 2),
                   p_digits = number_of_decimal_places_to_use_for_p_values (default is 3),
                   summary = TRUE or FALSE
)</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, you put into the function the name of your tibble, the
name of the variable you want the subgroup analysis for, and the names
of the variables containing the effect sizes and their variances.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you specify variables for <code>es_id</code> and
<code>study_id</code> then the function fits the models with
<code>rma.mv()</code> otherwise <code>rma()</code> is used.</li>
<li>By default a summary table is returned <code>summary = TRUE</code>,
but if you’d rather have a tibble containing the data for each group,
the models, and each models coefficients then use
<code>summary = FALSE</code>. Changing this default is useful only if
you want access to specific parts of the models.</li>

<strong>Tip</strong></p>
<p>If working in <code>quarto</code>, pipe the output of
<code>get_mas</code> into <code>knitr::kable</code> to get a nicely
formatted table and you can add styling and captions in the usual
way.</p>
<pre class="r panel_alt"><code>mod_tbl |&gt; knitr::kable()</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You might sometimes want to specify a forest plot that is split by
groups too. Again, I’ve got your back (well, assuming my dodgy functions
work). This package also has a function called
<code>metahelpr::forest_subgroups()</code>, which attempts to create a
forest plot with effect sizes grouped by a categorical variable.</p>

Code example</h4>
<p>For the current data we’d use this code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>metahelpr::forest_subgroups(tibble = brewin_foa_agg,
                 es = g,
                 var_es = v_g,
                 groups = foa_gp,
                 slab = author,
                 xlim = c(-2.5, 2.5),

                 cex = 0.5,

                 xlab = &quot;Memory disorganization&quot;,
                 shade = T)</code></pre>
<p>The first four arguments require you to specify the data
(<code>tibble = brewin_es</code>), the variable containing the effect
sizes (<code>es = g</code>), the variable containing the effect size
variances (<code>var_es = v_g</code>), the variable that you want to use
to group effect sizes (<code>groups = foa_gp</code>) and the variable
you want to use to label the studies (<code>slab = author</code>). All
the other options allow you to feed values into the
<code>forest()</code> function so see the section on <a

Alien coding challenge</h4>
<p>The code below and play about with the arguments from
<code>header</code> to <code>shade</code> to style the plot. Note I’ve
used the data in <code>brewin_foa_agg</code> so that each study
contributes a maximum of one effect size to each memory coding group on
the plot. For example, Jones et al. (2007) contributes 9 effect sizes to
<em>FOA detailed</em> and 3 to <em>FOA global</em> but in
<code>brewin_foa_agg</code> these have been averaged so that we plot a
single effect for each of those categories for Jones et al. (2007).</p>
<p>Change the data to <code>brewin_es</code> (where effect sizes have
not been aggregated) and see the difference.</p>

Writing up <span class="alt">(2)</span></h2>
<p>This package contains some functions that, when working in quarto or
Rmarkdown will help you to automatically extract and report certain
results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>report_het()</code>: collates information from heterogeneity
tests and outputs text that summarizes the results in a format that will
render nicely in quarto. Execute <code>?report_het</code> for help.</li>
<li><code>report_mod</code>: outputs text that reports (and renders
nicely in quarto/Rmarkdown) the omnibus statistical tests from a
moderation model. Execute <code>?report_mod</code> for help.</li>
<li><code>report_par_tbl</code>: outputs a tibble of the table of
coefficients of a meta-analyses object (<code>rma</code> or
<code>rma.mv</code>) created using the <code>metafor</code> package.
This function will mostly be useful for models containing predictors of
effect sizes (so-called meta-regression). Execute
<code>?report_par_tbl</code> for help.</li>
<li><code>report_pars</code>: outputs text that reports (and renders
nicely in quarto/Rmarkdown) the individual effects from a meta-analysis
model. Execute <code>?report_pars</code> for help.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calculating the overall group variance</h3>

to calculate the whole sample variance from the means, variances and
sample sizes of the two groups</p>
