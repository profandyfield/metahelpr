\title{Estimate Cohen's \emph{d} based on a correlation coefficient}
\usage{
d_from_r(delta, sx, r, biserial = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{the unit change required. This should be a numeric value set as the mean difference between groups on the key continuous measure, \emph{X}.}

\item{sx}{numeric value of the standard deviation of the key continuous measure, \emph{X}}

\item{r}{The correlation coeffcient to be converted}

\item{biserial}{When \code{TRUE} the standard formula for converting a point biserial correlation is used, when \code{FALSE} the function
treats the measures as continuous. In this case two options need to be set based on uses Mathur & VanderWeele (2019)}
}
\value{
Cohen's \emph{d}
}
\description{
When the raw information is not available to compute \emph{d}, #' it may be necessary to find it indirectly.
These conversions are approximations only. \code{d_from_r()} estimates Cohen's \emph{d} from a correlation coefficient.
When \code{biserial = TRUE} the standard formula for converting a point biserial correlation is used, when \code{biserial = FALSE} the function
treats the measures as continuous. In this case two options need to be set based on uses Mathur & VanderWeele (2019). First, \code{delta}
is the unit change required and should be set to the mean difference between groups on the key continuous measure, \emph{X}). second, \code{sx} must be set as the
standard deviation of the key continuous measure, \emph{X}). \emph{X} is the continuous variable version of the variable on which \emph{d} is computed for groups.
For example, if \emph{d} compares anxious vs controls, \emph{X} is a continuous measure of anxiety.
