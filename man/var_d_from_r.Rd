\title{Estimate the sampling variance of Cohen's \emph{d} based on a correlation coefficient}
\usage{
var_d_from_r(n = NULL, r = NULL, d = NULL, var = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the total sample size on which \emph{d} was based}

\item{r}{The correlation coefficient on which \emph{d} was based}

\item{d}{The estimate of \emph{d}. If \code{d = NULL} (the default) the variance us calculated assuming \emph{r} is a biserial correlation. If \code{d} is set to a value then the function
treats the measures as continuous based on Mathur & VanderWeele (2019).}

\item{var}{When \code{TRUE} the sampling variance is returned, when \code{FALSE} the standard error is returned.}
}
\value{
Sampling variance or standard error of Cohen's \emph{d}
}
\description{
When the raw information is not available to compute \emph{d}, #' it may be necessary to find it indirectly.
These conversions are approximations only. \code{\link[=d_from_r]{d_from_r()}} estimates Cohen's \emph{d} from a correlation coefficient and \code{var_d_from_r()} estimates the
associated sampling variance.
}
\details{
When \code{biserial = TRUE} the standard formula for converting a point biserial correlation is used, when \code{biserial = FALSE} the function
treats the measures as continuous. In this case two options need to be set based on uses Mathur & VanderWeele (2019). First, \code{delta}
is the unit change required and should be set to the mean difference between groups on the key continuous measure, \emph{X}). second, \code{sx} must be set as the
standard deviation of the key continuous measure, \emph{X}). \emph{X} is the continuous variable version of the variable on which \emph{d} is computed for groups.
For example, if \emph{d} compares anxious vs controls, \emph{X} is a continuous measure of anxiety.
